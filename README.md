A CNN-BiLSTM-SATA Model for Estimating Forest Aboveground Biomass from Multi-Source Remote Sensing Time-Series Data

While multi-source remote sensing data have been widely-used for forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation, conventional approaches predominantly rely on single-date or limited multi-temporal imagery, often neglecting the dynamic phenological information inherent in dense time-series data. To address this limitation, we developed a dual-scale time-series modeling framework integrating annual and seasonal modules within a CNN-BiLSTM-SATA architecture. The annual module utilized Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 imagery (2015-2018) to construct yearly composites and generate preliminary AGB estimates via a CNN-BiLSTM model. The seasonal module then incorporated high-temporal-resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery (2019), leveraging the annual estimates as static inputs and embedding a season-aware temporal attention (SATA) mechanism with seasonal encoding for final AGB estimation. Within this architecture, the CNN extracts local spatiotemporal features, the BiLSTM captures long-term temporal dependencies, and the SATA mechanism dynamically weights time steps based on their relative importance.
